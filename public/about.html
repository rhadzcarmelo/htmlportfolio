<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I don't aim to be the best; 
   I aim to keep getting better every day. 
   I am a career shifter. 
   It was challenging for me to step out of my comfort zone 
   but I'm glad that I made it! I can finally pursue my degree in 
   Information Technology. I will not forever live with my what if I try.
   I'm blessed and grateful to have given a chance to work as a Software Engineer 
   here at Accenture. I am eager to learn. I know that I will succeed as a developer.</p>

<p>When I’m not working or doing what I love,
   my friends and family are the most important thing in my life.
   They mean the world to me. When they’re around, 
   I feel like everything is possible.</p>

<p>My favorite part of my job is seeing how much happiness 
   can be brought into someone’s life when they’re feeling down 
   or stressed out. I know that by helping people feel better,
  we’re all better off as a community.</p>
